## Hi, I'm Lucas :)

I'm interested in a lot of stuff, so here's a quick summary:

#### What I like to use at the frontend
- Typescript
- Vue or Svelte

#### What I like to use at the backend
- Rust
- [Rocket](https://rocket.rs)
- PostgreSQL
- [FusionAuth](https://fusionauth.io) to handle authentication
- Docker

### A few projects I made

[CalendarServer](https://github.com/ItsaMeTuni/calendar-server) - [WIP] A calendar backend similar to the Google Calendar API, but free, open-source, and self hosted (I'm still looking for a name for it)

[Brainfuck+](https://github.com/ItsaMeTuni/brainfuck-plus) - An interpreter for [brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) with a few extra features

[gith](https://github.com/ItsaMeTuni/github-helper) - A little GitHub CLI tool for creating repositores I wrote for myself in python

[stejs](https://github.com/ItsaMeTuni/stejs) - A **S**imple **T**emplate **E**ngine for **J**ava**S**cript. It also has a webpack [loader](https://github.com/ItsaMeTuni/stejs-loader)
