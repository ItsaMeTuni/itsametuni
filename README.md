# Hi!

I'm a fullstack developer.

With almost **10 years** of experience I have professionally worked and played around (in hobby projects) with a vast array of technologies, ranging all the way from game development, to web development, to infrastructure management, to electronics. I have co-founded a couple startups and I'm currently co-founder and CTO at AnoniMe, an anonymous social network for Brazilian university students, and a CompSci undergrad. I'm also very interested in system design and have been recently getting my feet wet in AI and machine learning.

The tech stack I enjoy using the most:
- TypeScript
- Node.js
- React
- React Native
- AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- PostgreSQL and Redis
- Nest.js and Prisma

Some other stuff I know:
- Python
- Go
- Rust
- UE4 (C++ and Blueprints)
- Unity3D
- C
